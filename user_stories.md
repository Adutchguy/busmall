# User Stories

## Research Group

As a researcher I want to have the results of this study laid out in a easy to read format.

## Research Participants

As a participant I will need very basic and clear instruction on what I am supposed to do.

## Developer

As the developer I will need to ensure that I am able to meet the needs of both the research group and the participants and keep the visualization as uncluttered and clear as possible while also ensuring smooth and consistent functionality.
